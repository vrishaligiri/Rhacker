# Calculate Mean Median and Mode for given values (Level - Easy)

Objective 

In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, and mode. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 

Given an array, X, of  N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

Note: 

Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1  decimal place (i.e., 12.3, 7.0 format).

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in the array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

Output Format

Print 3 lines of output in the following order:

Print the mean on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place.
Print the median on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place.
Print the mode on a new line; if more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.
